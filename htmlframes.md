###Framework.

A framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem, which can be used as a reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature.
In the world of web design, to give a more straightforward definition, a framework is defined as a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.) 
which can be used to support the development of websites, as a basis to start building a site.
Most websites share a very similar (not to say identical) structure.
The aim of frameworks is to provide a common structure so that developers don’t have to redo it from scratch and can reuse the code provided. 
In this way, frameworks allow us to cut out much of the work and save a lot of time. 
Tosummarize: there’s no need to reinvent the wheel. Example of this frame works.
